# Simple Distributed Network Filesystem
A simple distributed filesystem which merges file data servers into a single volume accessable to all clients. No striping or redundancy.

The goal is to maintain an extremely simple and understandable design, and provide storage from an arbitrary number of data server as a single logical volume.
The goals are neither high performance, nor high available, nor data loss protection/recovery. Instead, this project aims for high utilization of available resources and ease of use.


There are three components of this project:
 - Data Server
 - Metadata Server
 - FUSE Module (client)
